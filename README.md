# Deeplearning solution for classification of Invoice Data 

The modern corporate world is filled with constant transactions, for example, objects and
services are bought and exhanged at a high rate; a rate which makes it increasingly difficult
for most big companies to keep an accurarate overview of their past spendings. The
spendings of a company are often documented in the form of invoices, where each invoice
represents an individual transaction. Due to the large amount of incoming invoices, and
the lack of training of employees in classifying invoices manually, invoices are often classified
into the wrong cost group. This can have considerable negative consequences for
a business such as large unforseen or unnessesary expenses, many of which could have
been avoided.

As a result the objective of this project will be to create an automatic invoice classification
system for a company using a real world dataset and three different machine learning
algorithms. The results show that it is possible to build effective classification baselines
using standard algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. In addition,
this thesis shows that classification is further improved with more complex transformer
architectures.
